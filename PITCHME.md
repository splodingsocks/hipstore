# Buckle Up!

- Making HTTP Requests
- Parsing JSON
- Routing

Note:

- These three things are essential to making most Web apps

# View Code is Pre-baked

- No writing view code today!
- Templates fresh from the oven.

Note:

- This talk isn't about how to write view code (HTML & CSS)
- I've conveniently created a package with view code that, when given the right data, will render the HTML for our store pages.

# Your Job

- Get the raw data
- Decode the raw data into the types we need
- Send updates to the server
- Route (render different views depending on what's in the location bar)

--- 

# Story Mode

Note:

Let's learn the things from the previous slide by building an app!

---

# Up and Running

[http://ellie-app.com](http://ellie-app.com)

**or**

`npm install -g create-elm-app`

Note:

Feel free to use a local Elm environment if you like. `create-elm-app` can get you going quickly. But if you don't already have Elm & Node installed, you can use Ellie. I'll use Ellie in the examples.

# Starter Kit!

Copy the code from the following link to get started: \<insert link here\>

+++

# Packages!?

The starter kit needs the following packages, let's get them installed!

- elm-lang/html
- krisajenkins/remotedata
- splodingsocks/hipstore-ui
- TODO: Whatever other packages we're using for routing 

+++

# What's In the Starter Kit?

- A basic app skeleton
- Stubs provided to hipstore-ui to make it compile (but not work, yet!)
- A pretend location bar so that we can see how routing will work, even when using ellie-app.com

---

# Showing Products

+++

## Get a feel for the api:

Visit [http://hipstore.now.sh](http://hipstore.now.sh) and read over the very short documentation.
‚è≥

+++

## üëÄ at the type we need for rendering a product (from hipstore-ui)

```elm
type alias Product =
  { id: String
  , displayName: String
  , tacos: Float
  , image: String
  }
```

+++

## üëÄ at the JSON we get from the server

```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Jame Octavio",
    "price": 850,
    "image": "aaron-alvarado-25213.jpg"
  }  
]
```

## Writing a decoder

- Video: writing a decoder

Note:

The decoder is so important. This is how we ensure that we have the data we need in order to move forward. If the data that's coming in is the wrong shape, we react appropriately instead of just crashing with a runtime error when the app code assumes the data has a shape that it doesn't. If the data comes in the wrong shape, but still has the information we need, we can use the decoding step to coerce the information into the correct shape. In other words: **JSON in, types out**.

+++

## Make room on the model

- See that the view code expects a `RemoteData err (List Product)`
- Add a slot of that same type on the model

+++

## Make a GET request

- Add `elm-lang/http`
- Build the request
- Add a Msg type for a finished request
- use `sendRequest` from RemoteData to create a `Cmd`
- Map the `Cmd (WebData (List Product))` to a `Cmd Msg`
- Hand the command to the runtime in the `init`

+++

## Pat yourself on the back

- Find the line where we're feeding fake data to hipstore-ui and replace it with the real data, and then feel good about yourself.

# Adding a Product to the Cart
+++
## Doing a POST request instead of a GET
+++
## Challenge: Implement deleting a product from the cart all on your own
---
# Moving the Cart to a Different Page
+++
## The Navigation package
+++
## Parsing the Path Into a Route
+++
## Constructing a Path From a Route
---
# Congratulations

You've now got a real fake SPA written in Elm!
